# Node.js Lesson 13 - Learning Summary

## What I Learned

### 1. Express Router
- How to create modular route handlers using `express.Router()`
- Separating routes into different files (`admin.js`, `shop.js`) for better organization
- Benefits: cleaner code structure, easier maintenance, reusable route modules

**Code example:**
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
router.get('/add-product', (req, res, next) => {
  // Handle GET request
});
module.exports = router;
```

### 2. Body Parser Middleware
- Using `body-parser` to parse URL-encoded form data
- Understanding `extended: false` uses querystring library (simpler, suitable for basic forms)
- Understanding `extended: true` uses qs library (supports nested objects)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

### 3. Routing Structure

| Route | Method | Purpose | File |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| `/` | GET | Homepage | shop.js |
| `/add-product` | GET | Display product form | admin.js |
| `/product` | POST | Process form submission | admin.js |

### 4. HTTP Methods
- **GET**: Retrieve/display content (forms, pages)
- **POST**: Submit data (form submissions)
- Proper separation of concerns between GET and POST handlers

### 5. Request/Response Handling
- Accessing parsed form data through `req.body`
- Using `res.send()` to send HTML responses
- Using `res.redirect()` to redirect users after POST requests (Post/Redirect/Get pattern)

**Example:**
```javascript
router.post('/product', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Access form data
  res.redirect('/');     // Redirect to homepage
});
```

## What Was Difficult

### 1. Middleware Order
Understanding that middleware **must** be registered in the correct order:

```javascript
// WRONG - routes before body-parser
app.use(adminRoutes);
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));

// CORRECT - body-parser before routes
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
app.use(adminRoutes);
app.use(shopRoutes);
```

**Why?** Express executes middleware top-to-bottom. If routes come before body-parser, `req.body` will be `undefined`.

### 2. Module Exports/Imports
Getting used to the CommonJS module system:

| Concept | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Export | `module.exports = router` | Make router available to other files |
| Import | `const adminRoutes = require('./routes/admin')` | Use router in main app |

**Challenge:** Remembering that each file needs to export its router and app.js needs to import them.

### 3. Route Matching Order
Understanding that Express matches routes **sequentially** and stops at the first match:

```javascript
// Order matters!
app.use(adminRoutes); // Checked first
app.use(shopRoutes);  // Checked second
```

If both files had a route for `/`, only the first one would be called.

### 4. Form Action Paths
Making sure form `action` attribute paths match POST route paths **exactly**:

```html
<!-- Form in GET route -->
<form action="/product" method="POST">
```

```javascript
// Must match exactly!
router.post('/product', (req, res, next) => {
  // Handle form submission
});
```

**Challenge:** A typo like `/products` vs `/product` causes 404 errors.

### 5. Understanding `next` Parameter
Every route handler receives `(req, res, next)` but we don't always use `next`:
- Use `next()` to pass control to the next middleware
- Don't call `next()` if you're sending a response (`res.send()`, `res.redirect()`)
